    <p> Slightly less late week 4  <br>
        The assignment for this week was centered around the vast world of email while learning about it and putting it to use. <br>
        In my case, I use email almost on the daily so I was already used to every feature we went over this week. <br>
        Gmail has been my main email tool for many years, as I've only recently started using Outlook for work-based communication. <br>
        <br>
        Because the power of email is so great there are many people who try and abuse it, email spoofing being a very large issue. <br>
        Little personal fact, since I work in technology already we've had to deal with spoofing in the past, as a quick glance may allow spoofing to happen. <br>
        Mailing lists were probably the thing I was least experienced in out of everything here, but I found some ones that revolve around Music and they caught my interest quite quickly! <br>
