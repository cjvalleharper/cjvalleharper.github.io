    <p> A very late week 3  <br>
        This first assignment focused around the use of ChatGPT, machine learning and AI as a whole. <br>
        I got the chance to interact with ChatGPT and ask it some questions as I noted its response. <br> 
        I found that it would also regenerate responses if I asked the same question more than once, so I used this to try and see how much its response would vary. <br> 
        Firstly I asked it a simple math question, "What is 1+1?" and it gave me the expected response of 2. Going again it still kept the same response, showing that it can stand on a correct response. <br>  
        After that I asked it the following: "Give me some suggestions for Music" and its response was a long list (image attached) spanning across various genres of music. Most of them seemed like pretty well-known and popular songs, but it was a list. <br>
        This was one of the responses that did regenerate upon asking the question once more, and it gave a different list. <br>
        Overall, in my time with ChatGPT I found it to be a pretty useful tool for getting simple tasks done however I can also recognize that many more tasks can be almost completely rendered null with its use, so ChatGPT and other AIs should be used sparingly in my opinion. <br>  <br>

        The second part of this assignment I chose to look into the Wayback Machine. This is something I've actually tried to use before, so I decided to give it a spin here. <br>
        I started off by following the link to the Wikiversity page from 2005 and just as expected I was able to look at a screenshot from August 28th 2005. This is when it really hit me with how powerful a website like this is. Storing one webpage already has so much use, now imagine that for as many as you can think of. <br>
        When it came to saving a page, I actually saved my own Github Repo for this class (https://github.com/cjvalleharper/cjvalleharper.github.io). As egotistical as it may seem, I find it very cool that through this quick action some of my work will be saved for as long as this website exists. A tool such as this may have no limits. <br>
