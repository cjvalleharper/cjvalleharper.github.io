    <p> Is this working? I hope it is!  <br>
        This assignment was set in place in order for us to become used to our browsers of choice, and make changes to them as needed for quality of life!  <br>
        I'm going to start with the browser I use most, Chrome!  <br> 
        Being my main browser meant that I was already familiar with the general use and settings I would be able to tweak  <br>  
        In regards to the browser. That being said, I do find myself often using the bookmarks tab, as well as extensions such as adblockers or other extensions as I need them for my use across the internet. <br>  <br>

        With Microsoft Edge, it was a little bit different. While I didn't normally use Edge, the interface was pretty straightforward and simple to use.  <br>
        One extension I decided to install was Grammarly, as my spelling is usually very shaky so I installed this in order to help ease the pain of typos.  <br>
        While I don't mind using Edge, I do prefer Google most of the time anyway, both browsers work fine however. <br>

        Looking at the HTML compatibility, both seem to support HTML5 just fine so that is great!
